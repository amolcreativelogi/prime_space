    <h3>Refund Policy</h3>

     <p>Every space is different. A single cancellation policy does not fit all booking types. Hosts can choose the appropriate policy that works best for their space and business. One of the following cancellation policies chosen by Host will be applied to each listing, except for On-Demand Parking.</p>



     <h6>Flexible</h6>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a full refund of fees, cancellations must be made a full 24 hours prior to listing’s local check in time (or 3:00 PM if not specified) on the day of check in. For example, if check-in is on Friday, cancel by Thursday of that week before check in time.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the renter cancels less than 24 hours before check-in, the first night is non-refundable.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the renter arrives and decides to leave early, the accommodation fees for the nights not spent 24 hours after the official cancellation are fully refunded.</p>



      <h6>Medium</h6>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a full refund of fees, cancellations must be made five full days prior to listing’s local start time (or 3:00 PM if not specified) on the day of check in. For example, if check-in is on Friday, cancel by the previous Sunday before check in time.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the renter cancels less than 5 days in advance, the first night is non-refundable but 50% of the accommodation fees for remaining nights will be refunded.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the renter decides to vacate early, 50% of the booking fees for the nights not spent 24 hours after the cancellation occurs are refunded.</p>



      <h6>Strict</h6>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a full refund of booking fees, cancellations must be made within 48 hours of booking and at least 14 full days prior to listing’s local check-in time (or 3:00 PM if not specified) on the day of check-in.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a 50% refund of booking fees, cancellations must be made 7 full days prior to listing’s local check in time (or 3:00 PM if not specified) on the day of check in, otherwise no refund. For example, if check-in is on Friday, cancel by Friday of the previous week before check in time.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the renter cancels less than 7 days in advance or decides to leave early after check-in, the nights not spent are not refunded.</p>



      <h6>On-Demand Parking (booking within 24 hours)</h6>

      <p>Bookings are non-refundable, regardless of your use or non-use of the Booking and regardless of any circumstance surrounding the use or non-use of a Booking (i.e., traffic or weather delays, cancellation of a related event).</p>
